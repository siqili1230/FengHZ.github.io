# Notes of Causal Inference-3
In note 1, we introduce the identification-estimation flowchart. And in note 2, we introduce the corresponding concepts in graphs.

Now we will introduce causal models and data into prior identification-estimation flowchart:

## The $do-$operator

Firstly we differ the conditioning and intervening:

The main effect of introducing causal models is finding all the confounders $X$, by which we can have unconfounderness assumption and do identification:

## Modularity assumption

Nextly, we introduce the modularity assumption:
