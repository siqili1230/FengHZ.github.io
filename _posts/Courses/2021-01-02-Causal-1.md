## What Does Imply Causation?

![image-1](\images\2021-01-02-Causal-1\image-1.png)

Consider following example, we cannot take 
$Y_i \mid  _{T=1} - Y_i \mid  _{T=0}$
as the causal effect because $Y_i\mid _{T=1}$ cannot represent the potential outcome of "if we take $T=1$". 

The main difference between causation and correlation is $Y_i\mid _{T=1}\neq Y_i\mid _{do(T=1)}$  

Here we calculate the true causal effect, $Y_i\mid _{do(T=1)}-Y_i\mid _{do(T=0)}$, noted as $Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]=\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)]-\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]\\
\neq \mathbb{E}[Y_i\mid T=1]-\mathbb{E}[Y_i\mid T=0)]
$$

which is because we have confounding association $C$:

## Identificability


Our goal is to calculate causal quantity with statistic quantity:

## Assumption 1: Ignorability

The igorability can be showed as following:
$$
\mathbb{E}[Y(1)]-\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]
= \mathbb{E}[Y(1)\mid T=1]-\mathbb{E}[Y(0)\mid T=0)]
$$

which means that the potential outcome $Y(1)$ is regardless of what the $T$ value is in practice. In the following table, the blankets in $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ columns are the unobservable outcomes. Those values are independent of whether corresponding $T$ is taken.

The ignorability can be described as:

$$
(Y(1),Y(0)) \perp \perp T
$$

Well, in another perspective, the ingorability can be viewed as exchangeability:

![image-4](\images\2021-01-02-Causal-1\image-4.png)

which means that the outcomes is independent of what data you choose (swaping A and B doesn't changes the expectations $y_0$ and $y_1$).

## Assumption 1: Conditional exchangeability

However, we don't know whether the data set satisfies exchangeability. Looking at the following example, we find that the distribution of "drunk/sober" in $T=1$ is different from it in $T=0$, where exchangeability is not satisfied.

![image-5](\images\2021-01-02-Causal-1\image-5.png)

So the conditional exchangeability is proposed that $(Y(1),Y(0))\perp\perp T\mid X$, where $X$ represents "drunk/sober".
So we have:

## Assumption 2: Unconfoundedness

Unconfoundedness is an untestable assumption that $X$ is the only confoundedness and there is no unobservable "W".

## Assumption 2: Positivity

Positivity demands that the support set is consist of the set $X$.

![image-8](\images\2021-01-02-Causal-1\image-8.png)

And if we don't have positivity, we have to predict the potential outcomes:

## Assumption 3: No Interference

No interference means that the choice of $T$ in other samples doesn't influence this outcome:

## Assumption 4: Consistency

The same $T$ must correspond to the same outcome.
